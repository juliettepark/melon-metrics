You must establish the existing need that your app addresses.
You can do this in several ways:
By gathering and synthesizing existing evidence (e.g. from prior research, news stories, etc.) to make a persuasive argument for the existence of a problem that your app will help with.
By conducting interviews with people who are among the population your app is meant to be helpful for. For example, if your app is intended to help people with a specific disability, you should interview people with that disability to understand their needs. Your evaluation must also include them.
By critiquing an existing app that addresses the need, and describing how the app could be improved.

BACKGROUND:
There is a sterotype around college students - equally well-known to the sterotype that they party and drink a lot - that students do not get sleep and are chronically stressed.
Terms such as "dead week" we know here at the University of Washington or the "Midnight Scream" event at UC Berkeley where students collectively relieve stress by releasing
a primal scream out their windows attest to the pressure that many students feel when taking on the rigour of higher education.

When experiencing high pressure, student tend to sacrifice their health in favor of more studying or better grades.
Although a comical example, videos such as [this](https://www.tiktok.com/@kaybchung/video/7444604107349970206) by a dental student during finals week
is an example of how students readily choose to down numerous cans of Red Bull energy drinks, pull all nighters, and sit stationary at their desks for long periods of time
as they feel that an approaching exam is more important than their health in the current moment.
But, there will always be an another exam around the corner, or another extracurricular activity one could be doing, or more notes to better consolidate from today's lecture.
Busyness and the frenzy of tasks to complete is not just a "finals week" problem, but a constant one that will not go away. Thus, student must prioritize their health
even amidst the chaos of everyday life.

SOLUTION:
HootHealth is an app where you can only take care of your pet by taking care of yourself!
By pulling metrics from the Health app on a mobile device, numbers such as
1. Sleep hours
2. Steps walked
3. Calories burned

each day all factor into a health score that determines the pet owlet's health.

By tying the owl and the user together, our app incentivizes users to prioritize caring for themselves
since their pet's health depends on it! Although we may feel totally fine to skip a meal ourselves, many
pet owners would be horrified if their dog or cat didn't eat dinner. In this same way, if users wish to keep
their pet healthy and happy, they have no choice but to consciously build better health habits for themselves.
