You must establish the existing need that your app addresses.
You can do this in several ways:
By gathering and synthesizing existing evidence (e.g. from prior research, news stories, etc.) to make a persuasive argument for the existence of a problem that your app will help with.
By conducting interviews with people who are among the population your app is meant to be helpful for. For example, if your app is intended to help people with a specific disability, you should interview people with that disability to understand their needs. Your evaluation must also include them.
By critiquing an existing app that addresses the need, and describing how the app could be improved.
Whichever route you choose, you should describe your approach, evidence, etc. in a file called docs/need.md.
