# Changes in response to audit

First audit -
Work we have done to improve the app based on audit feedback
1st Audit - We changed some of the colours on the audit page and home to a lighter shade. Specifically, the colour around the selected buttons in the bottom bar, and the colour of the IconToShow in the weather app. These new contrast for the nav bar is black-white which is sufficiently accessible.
We thank the auditers for pointing out this issue.

2nd Audit -
For the second audit, we decided to add a button after a user save their goals since this behavior is consistent with our calendar view page.
We dont think that there is any need for the success message in the settings view because when a user clicks "Save", they can immediately see the bars/ scores in the home page update based on their new settings. Furthermore, they can instantly see the Health State update (Poor/ ok/ Good) based on new settings.
