# Changes in response to audit

Although the audit gave us great feedback on the accessibility of our app, we decided to 
stick to our colour theme that we chose for all of the pages. This is so our app theme
could match our poster theme during our presentation.

For the second audit, we decided to add a button after a user save their goals since
this behavior is consistent with our calendar view page.
