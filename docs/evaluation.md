The usability of our app is flexible because of the customizable health goal
parameters which make it easy to scale the goals you want to set for yourself.
The utility of our app addresses the need well since our mission was to create
a simple and fun app that can help users keep track of their health. 

The app was SUS tested by performing a live demo to ten different users and 
asking them to fill out a form with the SUS testing questions. â€‹The average 
score was then calculated for each SUS testing prompt and the SUS testing 
score we received from the ten users was 95.
