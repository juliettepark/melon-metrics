You should find someone from another team in this course to audit your project.
When they do that, they should not have access to your code.
Instead, they should use your app.
This audit must be included in your submission in a file called docs/audit.md.
The file should say who did the audit (youâ€™d be amazed how often students forget to put their names on things) and what the commit id was that was used to build the version of the app they audited.
